- Big thanks to [IonutGherman](https://forum.xda-developers.com/m/ionutgherman.6250062/) from XDA for providing intial MBNs from crDroid.

# QPST/EFS Method
There's a old method with loading MBNs directly to the MODEM NV in folder `QPST EFS Method`
You can use it if this module doesn't work and you have proper MBN.
